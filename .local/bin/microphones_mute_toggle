# I've been using a shortcut to mute the default microphone for a while.
# I found it useful during meetings as my headset doesn't provide a dedicated mute button.
# Lately, I realized that I want all the connected microphones to be muted when I use the
# shortcut, as I never know if any of the multitude of meeting platforms I use might be
# misconfigured and taking audio from the non-default microphone.
# I usually have three mics always connected: the webcam one, the laptop one, and the headset one.
# Binding this script to the mute-shortcut I'll be sure that none of them is listening.

# 0 = unmute, 1 = mute
