# Toggle any window in Sway
#
# This script is meant to be bound to a shortcut. It allows me to open
# and close a specific window with the same keys combination.
# I initially created it to toggle KeePassXC with $meta+grave.
# As it uses a mark to identify the correct window, ensure you set an
# unique mark at window creation.
# In my case I use the following snippet to initially run KeePassXC at
# start up (.config/sway/config):
#
# for_window [ app_id="org.keepassxc.KeePassXC" ] {
#     sticky enable
#     floating enable
#     resize set 40 ppt 84 ppt
#     mark "toggle_KeePassXC";
# }
# exec keepassxc
