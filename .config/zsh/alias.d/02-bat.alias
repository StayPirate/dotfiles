type bat > /dev/null 2>&1 && {
	alias cat='bat'
	alias zbat='f(){ gzip -cd "$@" | bat }; f'
	alias zcat='zbat'
	# bat automatically pipes its output through a pager (by default: less)
	alias less='bat' # adding this alias the output will be handled again by less but it will be colorized first by bat
}
